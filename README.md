**Project Description: Two-Player Game Timer with 7x8 Segment Display**

This Arduino-based project is a versatile two-player game timer designed for competitive games that require precise time management. The system incorporates a custom-designed PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and an ergonomic housing for a polished and professional look. The primary components of this project include an Arduino board, a 7x8 segment display, buttons for each player, and supporting libraries.

**Key Features:**

1. **Segment Display:** The heart of the project is a 7x8 segment display controlled by the LedControl library. This display provides clear and visible feedback on each player's remaining time.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Each player has a dedicated button, making it intuitive for users to control and interact with the timer.

3. **Precise Timing:** The internal TimerOne library ensures accurate 1-second updates, allowing for precise countdowns for each player.

4. **Custom PCB:** The project features a custom-designed PCB, enhancing reliability and reducing the overall footprint. The PCB integrates seamlessly with the components and provides a clean and organized layout.

5. **Ergonomic Housing:** A carefully crafted housing enhances the user experience by providing a comfortable grip and ensuring the stability of the device during gameplay. The housing is designed to protect the internal components while offering easy access to buttons.

**Gameplay:**

Players start with an initial set time (configurable in the code) and press their respective buttons to initiate their countdown. The 7x8 segment display showcases the remaining minutes and seconds for each player. Once a player's time reaches zero, the corresponding "LOSE" message is displayed, indicating the end of their turn.

**GitHub Repository Contents:**

1. **Arduino Code:** The main sketch file (.ino) containing the Arduino code responsible for the functionality of the two-player game timer.

2. **PCB Design Files:** Schematics and board layout files for the custom-designed PCB, allowing users to reproduce or modify the PCB for their specific needs.

3. **Housing Design Files:** CAD files for the housing design, enabling users to 3D print or replicate the housing for the game timer.

4. **Documentation:** A detailed README.md file providing instructions on assembling the hardware, uploading the code, and customizing settings.

5. **License:** This is an open-source project that you are free to use for your own purposes. However, my request is for you to utilize this project as a guide to create your version, allowing you to master your skills.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for various competitive games, such as board games, chess tournaments, or any activity requiring timed turns. The combination of precise timing, a user-friendly interface, and custom-designed hardware makes it a compelling solution for gaming enthusiasts and developers alike. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to this open-source project on GitHub!
